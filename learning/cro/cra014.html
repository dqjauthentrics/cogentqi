                    reinvented the trial management wheel. We suggest that to improve the successful, timely delivery of important clinical trials for patient benefit, it is time
                    to produce standard trial management guidelines and develop robust methods of evaluation.</p></div>

                <div class="js-CollapseSection"><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Over the past 50 years, eminent trialists
                    have written persuasively and repeatedly of the need for large, randomised, controlled trials [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1</a></span>], and such
                    trials are considered the highest level of evidence for guiding clinical practice. However, how to manage these important trials has had little mention in most
                    commentaries. Many clinical trials fail to deliver because of the lack of a structured, practical, businesslike approach to trial management. The human and
                    financial resources for conducting a randomised trial is finite, so it is crucial that every effort is made to ensure that a trial is implemented simply and
                    managed efficiently. A randomised trial involves a huge investment of time, money and people; therefore, it warrants expert management and needs to be managed
                    from its inception like any other business. To review the literature, develop a protocol, apply for funding and design data collection forms requires lengthy
                    consultations and a considered approach. Rarely is this essential depth of thinking applied to how the trial will actually be managed. Trial management is
                    essential amongst the key competencies that are needed to deliver high-quality trials. It is recognised that well designed trials are the basis for addressing
                    important clinical questions, but science alone will not be sufficient to successfully deliver a trial. Once the science is determined and the trial accepted
                    through the peer review process, the challenge is quite different. The key challenge is then to establish and implement management systems and techniques that
                    are effective and responsive to the needs of the trial and the trialist [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2">2</a></span>]. Clinical trials all require the
                    same coordinated processes and systems, regardless of the size, scope, costs or duration.</p>
                    <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">An analysis of 114 multicentre trials funded by the National
                        Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and UK Medical Research Council (MRC), STEPS [<span class="CitationRef"><a
                                href="#CR3">3</a></span>], showed that 45% failed to reach 80% of the prespecified sample size. Less than one third of the trials recruited their
                        original target number of participants within the time originally specified, and around one third had to be extended in time and resources. One factor
                        observed in trials that recruited successfully was that they had employed a dedicated trial manager (odds ratio: 3.80, 95% CI: 0.79 to 36.14; <em xmlns=""
                                                                                                                                                                          class="EmphasisTypeItalic">P</em>
                        = 0.087). The STEPS collaborators suggest that anyone undertaking trials should think about the different needs at different phases in the life of a trial
                        and put greater emphasis on 'conduct' (the process of actually doing trials) [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3">3</a></span>]. In addition, the MRC
                        acknowledged that the failure of some trials can be due to practical problems with trial management rather than scientific problems or problems with the
                        trial design [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR4">4</a></span>]. Francis et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3">3</a></span>] examined
                        whether clinical trials could be considered from a business management perspective and proposed that the dimensions of running a successful trial includes
                        'marketing', 'sales' and 'ongoing client management'. They recognised that in the recruitment stage of a randomised controlled trial (RCT), the most
                        demanding activity is to establish and implement a range of effective management techniques which parallel those used to run a successful business.</p>

                        class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR5">5</a></span>] assembled and classified a comprehensive bibliography of factors limiting the quality, number and progress
                    of RCTs. They identified barriers to clinician participation that included, for example, time constraints, concern about the impact on doctor-patient
                    relationships, concern for patients, lack of reward and recognition, and an insufficiently interesting question. Barriers to patient participation included
                    issues such as additional demands of the trial, patient preferences, concern caused by uncertainty and concerns about information and consent. They recommended
                    that to overcome barriers to participation, a trial should address an important research question and the protocol and data collection should be as
                    straightforward as possible, with demands on clinicians and participants kept to a minimum. Dedicated research staff may be required to support clinical staff
                    and participants. The recruitment processes of an RCT should be carefully planned and piloted regardless of size or complexity.</p>

                            Management</em> suggest that actively managing every aspect of the trial is key to success. If clinicians are to recruit participants, they should feel
                        comfortable and trained in trial processes and procedures. This can be achieved using a variety of methods: one-to-one training, group work, distance
                        learning methods (videos via the web and teleconferences). National and international presentations and discussions to continually highlight the importance
                        of the trial must be organised by the trial team. Maintaining a personal interface with a collaborative group of clinicians, whether this is a group of 7 or
                        700, is probably the biggest challenge for a trial manager and the trial team but one that will result in a more cohesive trial.</p>

                            is recognised by the NIHR HTA programme, and they recommend that all primary research projects appoint a dedicated project/trial manager. Ideally, trial
                            managers should be involved early on in the trial design phase, but this is rarely possible because of funding constraints. However, a good trial
                            manager involved in the trial design and funding application will make a valuable contribution to the practicalities of conducting the trial,

                            knowledge available to guide trial managers is very limited. In 1998, Farrell [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR9">9</a></span>] described the need
                            for trial management models and methodology to be established, recognised and published to provide a body of evidence for those undertaking clinical
                            trials, large or small; yet more than 10 years on very little recognised reference material, other than <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">The
                                Guide to Efficient Trial Management</em>[<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR6">6</a></span>], is readily available. In addition to a trial
                            manager, an efficient, well-trained trial management team can be the deciding factor in the success or failure of a trial. The trial team will be
                            decided by the needs of the trial itself and, apart from the Chief Investigator, it should include a trial manager, a trial statistician, a trial
                            programmer, a data manager, data clerks, administrative staff and other trial specific staff, e.g., health economists. Each of these has an important
                            role to play, and clarity about exactly what each of the roles involves is crucial if every aspect of a trial is to be managed well; it requires a team
                            effort. In the UK, the recent development of research networks and the registration of Clinical Trials Units has seen the 'portfolio trial manager'
                            emerge. The portfolio manager has to deal with a variety of tasks across a range of trials which can present different challenges. The success or
                            failure of this approach will become apparent over the coming decade.</p>

                            developing a management plan is key for effective trial management. It is essential that a project management plan include details of the arrangements
                            for developing and monitoring all aspects of a trial, including servicing the steering committee and the independent data monitoring committee but, most
                            important, how the day-to-day running of the trial will be planned and managed. The development of a robust statistical analysis plan supported with
                            sufficient resources and time to conclude the trial efficiently is a crucial element of this plan. The project plan should also describe who will be
                            responsible for essential activities, such as staff recruitment, staff management, communication with the collaborative group, recruitment monitoring,
                            data management, and raising project awareness (promotion), through to safety reporting, analysis, report writing and dissemination of the trial
                            results. The project plan should describe what the trialists are trying to achieve, how resources will be used and within what time frame. It should
                            also include how the planned processes will be monitored to ensure that the project is being delivered as planned. The plan can then be reviewed and
                            refined, if necessary, as the trial progresses. Clear processes, both inside and outside the office, need to be established and documented. The ability
                            to constantly review and adapt the project plan is crucial as a trial can be hit side-on by events outside its control, e.g., emerging evidence, war
                            leading to lack of recruitment and natural disasters. Sensible risk assessment, tailored quality assurance management systems and real-time monitoring
                            are essential if a trial is to optimise its potential and provide reliable evidence.</p>

                        <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Good evidence that the clinical question being evaluated is in
                            equipoise is important, but it is only part of the equation. The question also needs to be relevant to clinicians and nurses as they are likely to be
                            the people recruiting the participants. To be successful, most trials depend on developing some sort of collaborative group. The aim of a collaborative
                            group or network is to be inclusive rather than exclusive. Proactively raising the profile of any developing project and creating a group of interested
                            people takes time and commitment. This can be done in many ways, through personal contact, presentations at relevant conferences, mailshots, newsletters
                            from the professional colleges, journal articles and general word of mouth. The success of a trial, particularly recruitment, may require thinking
                            'outside the box' and training, supporting and crediting other groups who are not traditionally directly involved in the research process but
                            nevertheless are crucial to a trial: for example, nurses, records department staff, ward clerks, radiology staff. A trial is likely to be more
                            successful, and enjoyable, if members of the collaborative group feel they 'own' the project. This ownership will be fostered by involvement and
                            consultation at every stage, from protocol development to publication of the results. All trials need to be actively promoted or marketed. Part of this
                            strategy will be a memorable name and/or identifiable logo and a thoroughly professional image. It is well established that interdisciplinary
                            collaboration offers greater potential for success [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR13">13</a></span>]. For large trials, this will be a diverse
                            multidisciplinary group including representatives from each participating site. For smaller and single-centre studies, the group will be less formal and
                            may be just a handful of like-minded people. Bammer [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR14">14</a></span>] identified that there is a growing body of
                            research on collaborations which include examinations of the increase in collaborations and team sizes, patterns of collaborative networks, motives,
                            choices and strategies for collaboration, the measurement of collaboration, how collaborations are organised and how successful collaborations are
                            measured. However, how these concepts are applied to trial management is unclear, and further observation and evaluation are necessary but difficult to
                            carry out. The only reliable way to obtain good evidence that business concepts work in a clinical trial would be to conduct a randomised trial. One
                            half of the trial would be managed according to a project plan and the other half left to run without a plan; we suspect this would be unacceptable to
                            any funder and certainly unacceptable to a good trial team. Some elements of trial management may be easier to evaluate, such as the best method of
                            ensuring data are completed and returned, but once again this carries an element of risk (as does any trial) and will have resource implications.</p>

                            the process of trial development. Ideally, dummy tables that reflect the final analysis would be prepared as part of the statistical analysis plan to
                            ensure that the data collection forms do not collect unnecessary data. This takes considerable discipline but will avoid omissions in the data
                            collection forms and minimise the collection of data that will never be reported. Experience has generated some simple tips for the design of data forms

                            progression and makes sense to the person completing the form. Data collected as 'free text' is not advisable, as this can considerably increase the
                            data management workload and increase the risk of misinterpretation of the data, but is nevertheless sometimes unavoidable. A recent article by Edwards

                            Collecting data by the use of a case report form and entering it into a database are quite simple tasks. However, ensuring that these data are sensible,
                            reliable and reflect the 'true situation' is a complicated and detailed process. With the aid of computers, data validation and quality control can be
                            quick and efficient, but these systems also need to be flexible and adaptable so that they can respond to the needs of the investigators and the
                            changing needs of the trial. Using systems that reduce the number of steps required for data entry, such as the use electronic data capture, can
                            minimise the workload for both investigators and the data management team. However, if trialists intend to use electronic data capture, a good deal of
                            preparatory work needs to go into form design and training to avoid adding to the workload. Adherence to database design, testing and validation

                            the review authors concluded that the research evidence base for strategies for increasing recruitment was poor and that further research was needed.
                            Experienced trial managers, who have learnt through apprenticeship, continually monitor, review and revise the recruitment strategies being used, and
                            this body of experience has been published online as part of <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">The Guide to Efficient Trial Management</em>[<span
                                    class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR5">5</a></span>]. To maintain recruitment at the necessary level over a long period of time, say, 3 to 5 years,
                            requires stamina in everyone involved in a trial. Strategies used to do this might include visiting sites where the trial is working well and seeing
                            what lessons can be learnt and applying them elsewhere. Using the experiences of individuals within the collaboration who are doing well to teach
                            others, either in newsletters or at meetings, is very valuable and encourages internal collaboration and capacity building. Ensuring there is always
                            clear, professional literature regarding the trial at recruiting sites is a task that a good trial manager will incorporate into the project plan. If
                            promotional material is not updated regularly with new eye-catching information, it quickly becomes just part of a sea of other information and all
                            impact is lost. Making sure the trial team go to meetings prepared, i.e., knowing how sites are recruiting, the quality of the data collection and who
                            are the most important people to meet to discuss the trial's progress, should be a 'given', but this is not always the case.</p>

                            component of the project development and management plan. For collaborative trials, it is vital that appropriate credit is given where it is due and
                            that everyone who has wholeheartedly contributed gains recognition in one way or another. This will often mean publication of the results as a
                            collaborative group. Group authorship is a particular issue for trial managers as under the collaborative authorship policy rarely does the trial
                            manager get acknowledged for their individual contribution. This is a real concern for those working toward making trial management their career pathway
                            and those working to promote a career structure for trial managers.</p>
                        <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">The trial will mean nothing if the results are not disseminated
                            and taken account of in clinical practice. Results of a trial can be made widely available using a variety of media, such as articles in medical
                            journals, online journals, trial registers, systematic reviews and conference presentations. An advantage of a multicentre trial is that each
                            investigator, working within an agreed policy, can be responsible for local dissemination and presentation. Trial results should be published whatever
                            the outcome of the trial, and it has been described as scientific misconduct not to publish [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR19">19</a></span>].
                            Reporting the results must maintain confidentiality, and it must not be possible to identify individual participants or sites within the report. The
                            CONSORT Guidelines [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR20">20</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR21">21</a></span>] provide a standard
                            for reporting clinical trials which aims to improve the quality and transparency of trial reporting.</p>

                                href="#CR12">12</a></span>] specifies that every member of a trial team should have the appropriate education, training and experience to perform
                            his or her tasks. For a trial manager of any trial, it is difficult to comply with this regulation as specialised training in trial management does not
                            exist and there is no recognised qualification that can prove that a trial manager has been educated in the discipline. Much of the collective wisdom
                            about doing trials has been passed on by apprenticeship, very much a 'suck it and see' approach which can be to the cost of the trial and the trial
                            manager. For those wishing to pursue a career in trial management, the lack of good practice guidelines and standards can be extremely challenging and
                            at times very frustrating. A survey undertaken by the UKTMN in 2005 identified the need for courses in practical management of clinical trials. Of the
                            284 trial managers surveyed, 60% were not seeking higher education qualifications but wanted flexible, accessible, specific training relevant to their
                            jobs. For those who do want to study for a higher qualification, the distance learning MSc/Post Graduate Diploma in Clinical Trials by Distance Learning
                            [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR22">22</a></span>] has been developed by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of
                            London. The MSc includes project management principles as one of the fundamentals of trial conduct. Many other courses and workshops on clinical trials
                            also include an element of project management skills training. However, although intuitively trial managers are utilising these skills, more evidence is
                            needed to support the application of project management principles and practices to clinical trial management for future trialists.</p>

                    need for those planning and doing trials to have reliable and rapid access to relevant expertise and for published standards for trial management (conduct) that
                    avoid trialists' reinventing the wheel. Trial managers have, in recent years, begun to develop better ways of disseminating and sharing experiences and
                    expertise. Societies and associations of trial managers in North America and Europe are beginning to network and make their knowledge available via the Internet
                    and through journal publications. The acknowledgment by the UK Medical Research Council in setting up the UK Trial Managers' Network in 1998 highlighted the
                    need to share expertise in this field and to bring together trial managers who have no professional forum in which to network. Experienced trialists will have
                    put together, either formally or informally, plans and checklists of essential steps in the development of a trial on the basis of their experience of what does
                    or does not work. Those planning their first trial often have to start from scratch unless they are lucky enough to have access to a clinical trials unit or
                    someone with relevant experience. Many trials struggle to finish, or even to get underway, because the people running them have not been able to find
                    information about the best processes for establishing and delivering a trial. There is a need for appropriate training which is easily accessible, but the real
                    problem is the lack of a standard method which will ensure high-quality trial management. Having such a standard would ensure that both funders and trial
                    managers maximise the trial investment and the chances of success. Much of trial management is intuitive utilisation of skills gained in other areas of work or
                    on the basis of experience and as such could not be the subject of robust research methodologies. Robust, meaningful and enforceable standards for the
                    management of trials would require effort on behalf of a collaborative group (using trial management principles), including funders, investigators, trial
                    managers and other interested groups and would take time but would do much to move the issue forward. If such a standard could be agreed on, this would more
                    accurately identify training requirements and open the door to more appropriate research into what is undoubtedly a vital component in successfully completing a
                    clinical trial.</p></div>

                <div class="js-CollapseSection"><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">The very important and internationally
                    accepted CONSORT Guidelines were developed because there was a will to improve the way important research was published. There is the same will amongst
                    trialists to improve trial management methods and provide sound published evidence to be used to successfully evaluate important health research. We urge that
                    funders, trialists, trial managers and all interested groups come together, led by opinion leaders in the field, to discuss and debate trial management methods
                    with the aim of providing a standard for trial management and a guideline for those running clinical trials to work toward. We also suggest that the editors of
                    medical journals might want to consider the importance of how good research is actually carried out and require that trial management methods be part of
                    articles considered for publication. If trial management continues to be unrecognised through a lack of standard methodology and training, it will be to the
                    detriment of future research and health care.</p></div>
