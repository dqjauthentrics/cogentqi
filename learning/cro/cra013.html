            <p class="Abstract">The online 10-Week Clinical Research Associate (CRA) On-Boarding Program is appropriate for individuals with less than two years of experience as a
                CRA. The
                course provides practical, hands-on training as it relates to the CRA job function, and covers core sponsor and research site activities that promote the successful
                monitoring of studies for drug, biologic, and device trials. The course follows an ICH/ISO global GCP framework, and covers how to identify specific country
                requirements,
                making it appropriate for both U.S. and global audiences. Good Clinical Practice (GCP) skills are reinforced through a combination of activities, including lecture,
                case
                studies, and scenario review, as well as application-based homework assignments.</p>
            <p class="Abstract">The course is built on Barnett’s deep in-person CRA training experience and is designed for “on-boarding” of individual new hires or entire teams.
                If you
                are a CRA manager or human resources professional responsible for the orientation and training of one new CRA or 100, this course provides a convenient,
                cost-effective,
                comprehensive, and interactive training method. You’ll have peace of mind knowing that you are training your new hires to the highest industry standards.</p>
            <p class="Abstract">The resources required to take this on-line course are already at your fingertips - an Internet connection and a phone. After registering, you will
                receive
                an email confirmation that provides you with the Web Seminar link and audio connection information.</p>
            <p class="Abstract">Prior to the start of the course, participants will receive comprehensive course materials. Come to class prepared to interact – you will be able to
                ask
                questions, provide feedback and participate in discussions and group work. Upon course completion, participants will be provided training certificates. In order to
                receive
                accreditation CEUs, participants are required to pass both a mid-term and final exam. Upon completion of the exams, CEU certificates will be provided.</p>

            <p class="Abstract"><strong>What previous students have said ...</strong></p>
            <p class="Abstract">“The CRA course increased my awareness of the importance of developing strategies and risk-based approaches to monitoring. The breadth of knowledge
                and
                experience of the trainers was impressive. The overview of quality systems and regulatory expectations will surely have a place in my daily monitoring
                activities.” </p>
            <p class="Abstract">“This program opened the door for me to really understand what a CRA does and how to document everything. It gave me a true guideline as I manage
                expectations of all parties and what to look out for during visits, as well as how to document findings in a responsible, accurate way. Thank you so much.” </p>
            <p class="Abstract">“I have been given a solid framework on how to approach future studies from site selection, protocol development, and inclusion/exclusion importance
                to
                regulatory considerations (when to report what to whom). I plan to make use of all the monitoring tools provided to achieve success and utilize EDC for ease of CRF
                collection. When in doubt, I will always refer back to modules for guidance. Great course, thanks!”&#160;&#160;</p>
